5 September: The cross-intermine template project is being temporarily rested in favour of other projects. Here's my set of notes:

## Which templates to use?

Well, you can sort this by ubiquity:
 http://mine-comparison.apps.intermine.org/templates

 Right now there's only one template name shared amongst all 7 mines, and it's Gene_Protein. So instead, let's extract the query from the template and run the queries directly in each mine. Show results separately on a mine by mine basis if they succeed.

## How do we query each mine?

Input: Gene(s). Organism. Assume we search all available output organisms automatically. doesn't need to be on the screen by default (as the go tool was).

### Data flow

1. Take input listed above. Resolve in the origin organism mine (e.g. a zebrafish gene needs to be run through ID resolution in zebrafishmine). Save this data as it maps from the input gene to the primary ids.
2. Query each mine based on the resolved primary ids.
  2.1 Advanced query stategy
    - try direct, e.g. ask zebra if it has mouse homologues
    - reverse - ask mouse if it has zebra homologues
    - via human hub, same as above direct and reverse, then to mouse...
3. before we do this, create a table of inputs, outputs, and expected results. static snapshot data from each mine and ensure the tests resemble the expected results from static data.

## The other thing:

This interface might be suitable for many cross-intermine searches. Kthxbai.
